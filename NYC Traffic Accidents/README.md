## About Data
Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January to August 2020. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time, and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

## The Objectives
Analyze the data with the purpose of finding interesting patterns and trends to help the NYPD prevent future accidents.

## The Objective
1. Calculate the number of collisions by month and year, and visualize them using line charts
2. Calculate the number of collisions by time of day and day of week, and visualize the data using a heatmap.
3. Find the top 10 contributing factors by number of collisions, and calculate the percentage of the collisions involving injuries or fatalities.

## Key Findings
- There is a seasonal pattern (from 2021 to 2023) where the accidents were decreasing in February, but started to increase again with a peak amount of accidents in June. After June, the pattern was steady, even decreasing after October.
- The accidents often occur between 2 pm - 6 pm (mostly on Friday).
- The accidents mostly occurred on Belt Parkway Street, with a total of 3.728 accidents.
- The accidents were mostly caused by Driver Inattention/Distraction. The accidents with a high percentage of dangerous level (that could injure/kill somebody) were caused by Failure to Yield Right-of-Way.
