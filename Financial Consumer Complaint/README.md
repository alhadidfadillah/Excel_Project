# Consumer Complaint Tracking
## About Data
Consumer complaints on financial products & services for Bank of America from 2017 to 2023, including the dates the complaint was submitted to the CFPB and then sent to the company, the product and issue mentioned in the complaint, and the company's response.
## The Goals
Create a report to track open and closed complaints for a specific period and visualize the weekly trend to avoid overdue complaints.
## The Approaches
1. Calculate Top-level KPIs: calculate top-level KPIs by flagging complaints as "Open" or "Closed" and creating a PivotTable to count the complaints for each status.
2. Visualize the Weekly Trend: create a new PivotTable that shows the "Open" and "Closed" complaints by week, then visualize the trend using a stacked column chart.
3. Finalize the Report: add formatting and polish to the report by modifying the KPIs, chart, and timeline filter.
