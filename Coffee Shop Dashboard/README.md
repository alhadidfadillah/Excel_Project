# Coffee Shop Dashboard
## About Data
Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. The dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp, and location, along with product-level details.
## The Goals
Transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.
## The Approaches
1. Prepare the Data for Analysis: Explore the coffee shop dataset, conduct some basic data QA and profiling, and add calculated date and time fields to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Explore the Data: Slice and dice the coffee shop data with Excel PivotTables, and create views to analyze time series and product-level trends.
3. Build a Dynamic Dashboard: Visualize the data with Pivot Charts, design an interactive dashboard, and identify insights and recommendations for the coffee shop.
## Key Findings
- The coffee shop sales exhibit a positive trend as the month progresses across all three places (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Manhattan).
- Coffee is the most ordered by category, while Packaged Chocolate is the least ordered.
- Monday, Thursday, and Friday tend to be the peak sales days of the week.
- Weekends experience significantly lower sales compared to weekdays.
- Between 8 am and 10 am is the peak sales hour every day.
- Barista Espresso and Brewed Chai Tea are the most popular products.
## Recommendations
- Focus on staffing and stocking during peak sales periods: Morning rush (8 am - 10 am) on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays.
- Consider adjusting business hours, considering the drastic decrease in sales after 7 pm and on weekends. Suggested hours are 6 am to 7 pm on weekdays and reduced hours on weekends.
- Remove Packaged Chocolate items from the menu.
