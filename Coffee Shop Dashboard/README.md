# Coffee Shop Dashboard
## About Data
Transaction records for Maven Roasters, a fictitious coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. The dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp, and location, along with product-level details.
## The Goals
Transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for the business.
## The Objectives
1. Prepare the Data for Analysis: Explore the coffee shop dataset, conduct some basic data QA and profiling, and add calculated date and time fields to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Explore the Data: Slice and dice the coffee shop data with Excel PivotTables, and create views to analyze time series and product-level trends.
3. Build a Dynamic Dashboard: Visualize the data with Pivot Charts, design an interactive dashboard, and identify insights and recommendations for the coffee shop.
