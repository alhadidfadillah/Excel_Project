# Build an interactive tool to explore the artwork at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)
This research dataset contains 157,630 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in their database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not Curator Approved.”

## The Goals
Create a tool that allows us to select nationality, artist, minimum year of creation, and display their earliest work.

## The Steps
1. Clean and prepare the data.
2. Extract artist information
3. Display their work
