# Manufacturing Downtime Analysis

## About Data
Productivity & downtime data for a soda bottling production line, including information on the operator, product, start & end times, and downtime factors for each batch.

## The Objectives
Analyze the manufacturing productivity and downtime, and find ways to work with the operating staff to improve efficiency.

## The Approaches
1. Calculate line efficiency for a production line and break it down by operator.
2. Use a Pareto chart to identify the main factors for downtime in the production line.
3. Use a matrix to calculate the total downtime by operator for each of the main factors you identified.

## Key Findings
- Mac is underperforming, which has the worst efficiency compared to the other.
- Machine adjustment, machine failure, inventory shortage, batch change, and batch coding error are the top 5 factors that account for the manufacturing downtime.
- 3 of the 5 main downtime factors are due to operator error (machine adjustment, batch change, batch coding error).

## Recommendations
- Focus on machine adjustment for every operator and batch change training for Mac to improve production efficiency.
- Double-check check inventory level and apply preventive maintenance to the machine.
- Focus on the five main causes of production stoppages (machine adjustment, machine failure, inventory shortage, batch change, and batch coding error) and prepare preventive measures.
